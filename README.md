# üçã Lemon Whisper

Lemon Whisper is a minimal macOS tool to:

- Record your voice anywhere
- Transcribe locally with Whisper.cpp
- Paste the text automatically
- Never send your audio to the cloud

## ‚ú® Features

- **Two transcription modes:**
  - **Base Transcription**: Record complete audio, then transcribe when you stop (more accurate)
  - **Live Transcription**: Real-time transcription as you speak with automatic pause detection
- Local-only transcription with Whisper.cpp
- Quantized Whisper model (Q5)
- Voice Activity Detection to avoid false positives
- Language selection through menu bar
- Hotkey integration with Hammerspoon
- Smart menu bar indicator (üçã idle, üìù working)

## üöÄ Quickstart

Open your Terminal and run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JeffryCA/lemon-whisper.git
cd lemon-whisper
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Install Homebrew** (if you don't have it):

   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   brew install cmake
   ```

3. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Hammerspoon:**

   ```sh
   brew install --cask hammerspoon
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install Whisper.cpp and Models

1. Make the installer script executable:

   ```sh
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

2. If you **already have Whisper.cpp built elsewhere** and want to avoid duplication, set the environment variable:

   ```sh
   export WHISPER_CPP_PATH=/path/to/your/whisper.cpp
   ```

3. Run the installer:

   ```sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

This will:

- Clone and build Whisper.cpp if needed
- Download the quantized model and VAD model if missing
- Create the `temp` folder

‚úÖ No additional edits needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Hammerspoon

Hammerspoon handles the global hotkey and the üçã indicator.

1. Open Hammerspoon (`/Applications/Hammerspoon.app`)
2. Click the menu bar icon > **Open Config**
3. Add the code from the `init.lua` file in this repository to your `init.lua` file.
   > **Important:** Replace `/full/path/to/lemon-whisper` with the absolute path to your Lemon Whisper folder.
4. Save the file.
5. In the Hammerspoon menu, click **Reload Config**.

## üé§ Usage

### Choosing Transcription Mode

Click the üçã icon in your menu bar to choose between:

- **Base Transcription**: Traditional record-then-transcribe workflow
- **Live Transcription**: Real-time transcription as you speak

You can also select your preferred language from the same menu.

### Recording and Transcribing

1. Place your cursor where you want the transcribed text to appear.
2. Press `Ctrl + Y` to start recording.
3. **For Base Mode**: Speak your message, then press `Ctrl` to stop and transcribe.
4. **For Live Mode**: Speak naturally - text appears in real-time with automatic pause detection.
5. The transcribed text will be automatically copied and pasted.

**Notes:**

- While recording, macOS shows a microphone indicator in the menu bar.
- The üçã icon changes to üìù during processing.
- For Live Mode: If you pause for 0.6 seconds, it triggers transcription automatically.
- If you record less than 0.5s, transcription is skipped.

## ‚ú® Configuration

### Transcription Settings

You can adjust transcription settings by editing the Python files:

- **Base mode settings**: Edit `base.py`
- **Live mode settings**: Edit `live.py`
  - `PAUSE_THRESHOLD`: Silence duration (default: 0.6s) before triggering transcription
  - `VAD_THRESHOLD`: Voice activity sensitivity (default: 0.6)

### Menu Configuration

The Hammerspoon menu allows you to:

- Switch between Base and Live transcription modes
- Select transcription language (Auto, English, Spanish, German, etc.)
- See current mode and language selection with checkmarks
